## Project Overview

### P1: Investigate a Dataset (Gapminder World Dataset)

This chapter focused on the entire data analysis process. Everything was covered, from data collection to cleaning, analyzing, and wrangling to exploring and displaying the data, as well as the programming workflow and communication. 

As a result, this project covered every step of the standard data analysis procedure. This includes the following:
- posing questions
- gather, wrangle and clean data 
- communicate answers to the questions 
- assisted through visualizations and statistics. 

Out of the project:

>This project will look into the Gapminder datasets. To be more specific, it will examine the life expectancy of populations in  countries, as well as the effects of other variables. It will also examine the evolution of these variables, with the goal of identifying trends that are linked to a longer life expectancy and income per person.

>**What is Gapminder?** 
"Gapminder is a non-profit organization based in Sweden with no political, religious, or economic ties. Gapminder is a fact-checking organization, not a think tank. Gapminder is a non-profit organization that tackles harmful myths about global development."  (https://www.gapminder.org/about-gapminder/)

Here we were confronted with the full joy of a real-life dataset: from hard-to-analyze structure, missing, messy, dirty data to real and - after finally being done with data wrangling - the reward of interesting insights. 


**Key findings**:
<ol>
    <li><p>I can see an overall and continuing upward trend in the world population, per capita income, and life expectancy.</p></li>     
    <li><p>Between 1950 and 1975, in particular, there was a considerable growth in all three metrics.</p></li>     
    <li><p>The global population is rapidly growing, with one apparent reason being an increase in general life expectancy.</p></li> 
	<li><p>I also discovered that there is a clear association between per capita income and life expectancy. Although an increase in income does not ensure an increase in life expectancy, it is likely to happen to some extent.</p></li>
